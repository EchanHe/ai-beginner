# AI and Machine Learning for Biologists

This repository is designed to provide resources and materials to help biologists (or just beginner) to learn about AI and machine learning. The goal is to build interdisciplinary understanding and collaboration.

## Basic Knowledge

**Python**

[Python for Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)

TODO More recommendation on the tutorial

## Courses

- Basic: [Machine Learning Specialization - Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction#courses)
- Intermediate: [Deep Learning Specialization - Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

Both courses are taught by Andrew Ng, so the course contents are consistent. The course are very intuitive and beginner friendly. There are exercise after each session\


## Blog

Blogs can be intuitive and it has more figures, and sometimes Gifs.

## Languages and libraries

- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)

I recommend to visit [PyTorch tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/) and find things that you are interested and try to run and change the codes.

## Research Papers

TODO

<Add relevant research papers here>





## Books

It less exciting and slower to learn from books, but it is always the most systematic way to do it.

1. "Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective" - Kevin P. Murphy
2. "Deep Learning" - Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville
